    <h2 class="section-title glow">Why JAOLA Exists</h2>
    <p>Most systems require perfection before they offer support. JAOLA was built to intervene before people get denied, dropped, or dismissed. Our mission is rooted in accountability, clarity, and care — and our founder ensures that every client interaction is backed by real documentation, trauma-awareness, and structural skill.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title glow">Founded in the heart of Utah — Salt Lake City</h2>
    <p>JAOLA was born in Salt Lake City — a place of contrast, community, and quiet resistance. This city shaped our fight, our fire, and our refusal to accept systems that silence people. We were built here — and we fight from here.</p>
