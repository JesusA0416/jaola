  <!-- WHY US -->
  <section class="mission" id="why-jaola">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="section-title">Why JAOLA?</h2>

    <p>JAOLA isn’t a hotline. It’s not a folder of forgotten referrals. It’s a functioning care and housing service model — built by someone who knows what it feels like to fall through every crack.</p>

    <p>We exist because real people are trying to survive stacked barriers. A lease written in legal jargon. A caseworker who doesn't respond. A family member who needs daily help while paperwork sits untouched. JAOLA was created to meet people at that breaking point — and to offer actual structure in place of chaos.</p>

    <p>Here’s what makes us different:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Housing clarity, not confusion.</strong> We walk tenants through rental agreements, notices, evictions, and lease terms — with patient, bilingual, trauma-aware explanations. Nothing gets skimmed. Every document is reviewed, translated if needed, and explained fully.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Landlord accountability.</strong> JAOLA actively manages properties and consults with new landlords to implement fairer, legally informed rental practices. We assist with onboarding tenants, writing equitable leases, and avoiding discrimination claims before they happen.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Forms, notices, and proof — done right.</strong> We help clients draft responses, fill out required housing paperwork, and create timelines for everything from rental renewals to emergency extensions. Our documentation is clean, compliant, and ready to defend in court if needed.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Care that’s licensed, bounded, and real.</strong> Our founder is CNA-certified. JAOLA provides in-home, non-medical care including hygiene assistance, medication reminders, mobility support, and companionship — all within documented care plans. We do not freelance care. We plan it.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Follow-through is built in.</strong> No loose ends. Every service comes with written next steps, follow-up deadlines, and clear expectations. Clients are never left wondering what happens next.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are not a one-time form. We are not a case number. We are not a student internship hoping for experience.</p>

    <p>JAOLA is infrastructure.  
    It’s lease prep, compliance navigation, personal care, and client advocacy — built into one service pipeline for people who don’t have time to beg for one thing at a time.</p>

    <p>When you contact us, you’re not asking for help. You’re inviting us to take something off your shoulders — with clarity, care, and a legal trail.</p>
